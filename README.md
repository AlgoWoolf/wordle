# Explanation of Gameplay
- Each time the page loads, a random 5-letter word is chosen (but not revealed to the user). The user must then use the digital keyboard to enter their guess, which must be a legitimate word. The user must guess the correct word within 6 guesses to win the game. After each guess, the user will receive hints via the color of each letter tile. If a tile is green, it means the letter matches perfectly with the correct word. If it is yellow, the letter is in the correct word, but in a different spot. If it is gray, the letter does not appear anywhere within the correct word.
